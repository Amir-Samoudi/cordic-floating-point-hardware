# Verilog Implementation of CORDIC-based Floating-Point Hardware

This repository contains the **Verilog implementation of floating-point hardware units** for calculating the **reciprocal** and **square root** of a number using the **CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)** algorithm.  
The project demonstrates how iterative based CORDIC operations can approximate mathematical functions in hardware.
